1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): Initialize new JupyterLab extension project `jupyterlab_show_commands_reference_extension` with Claude Code configuration<br>
   **Result**: Created project using JupyterLab extension copier template. Extension provides a command to display all available JupyterLab commands with their full reference IDs (e.g., `iframe:open`) and arguments in a new tab - serving as a reference help page for developers. Initialized `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import directive and project-specific context including Mandatory Bans section. Created `JOURNAL.md` for session tracking. Updated `README.md` with standardized badges (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, downloads, JupyterLab 4, KOLOMOLO, PayPal donate) and concise feature list. Git repository initialized with `git init -b main` and initial commit created with all artefacts including `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
